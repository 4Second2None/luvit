This file is a place to organize my thoughts about the new API and the files in
lib.

core.lua - (no deps) This contains many core objects written in pure lua.  It
           has no dependencies since it's early on in the bootstrap process.

uv.lua - (depends on core.lua) This is like core, except wraps the various libuv
         struct types in lua classes and wraps the uv functions into methods.

luvit.lua - (depends on uv.lua) This is the first script executed.  It defines
            the require system and the command-line behavior of luvit.

net.lua - (high level, depends on many) This mirrors somewhat closely the net
          module in node.  It uses uses several other modules. It covers tcp and
          unix socket servers and clients.  This module includes smarts like
          connection timeouts.

http.lua - (depends on net.lua and http_parser) Implements http servers and
           clients using net.lua as the underlying transport.
